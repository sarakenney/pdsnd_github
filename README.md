2. Popular Stations and Trip
* Most common end station

4. User info
* Counts of each user type

The Project also prompts the user to choose from the following options to filter the raw data:

1. Would you like to see data for Chicago, New York or Washington?
2. Would you like to filter the data by month, day or not at all?
3. (If they choose month)Which month - January, February, March, April, May or June?
4. (If they choose day)Which day - Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, or Sunday?

The script also anticipates user error and at the end prompts the user if they would like to"
